# JS Clock App

Deployed at: https://archonology.github.io/Clock-App/

# Description
For the new year I'm sharpening up my JS skills with [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com/).  It's an awesome, free program that helps you kick up your vanilla JS skills notch.
This second project is a clock built with vanilla JS and CSS.  Check out the deployed page to see what time it is! :)
